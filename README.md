## Description

- What was your motivation?
Challenging myself is what I always crave for. The main motivation behind this project is do something challenging and apply what I have learned. Eager to learn how I can apply my skills to build this quiz app was my main motivation.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
I love playing games since when I was child and typing game was one of them from which I was able to improve my typing skills. I used to wonder how this kind of games are made and I am finally able to make this quiz game and witness myself how it works. Applying what I have learned to create this game was my main reason behind to build this project.

- What problem does it solve?
I was having challenges with JavaScript about how it actually works and putting down all the pieces of information helped me to figure out importance of JavaScript. I am also able to build any quiz game and help me to build more fun games.  

- What did you learn?
What I learned from this project was use of QuerySelector, array, styling CSS, making code more clean by putting comments. I have also learned how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript actually works.
